## Creating Interactive Dashboard on Kibana
### Search on Kibana with timeString

Click Visualize then click + button on the middle of the page, it will pop-up types of visualization menu then you can select one of your favorite charts. Then it opens the saved search item, you can select the search you saved in the previous step.

### Kibana setting the metrics and buckets
I choose the bar chart, later I will add one column to show the number of success, failure, and error. As you can see from the picture above you need to define the Metrics and the picture below shows how to split the chart for each run by setting the Buckets.
