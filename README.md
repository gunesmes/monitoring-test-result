## Centralization of Log Systems For Automated Test
In a development pipeline, we have a variety of tools and technologies with different languages and scripts. CI/CD pipeline is a good place the see the process of the development, but to get the detail of an item in the pipeline, we need to get into that item and tackle with logs and data. Some times this investigation requires some capabilities to understand it. One of the easiest ways to get a common understanding from the logs in the pipeline is using one easy tool for the whole process. When we collect all the logs and data into one place then we can start debugging activity from here. Therefore the centralized log system means that all the logs and data related to the development pipeline should be stored in one place with a timestamp and/or tags for data separation.

## Export data to Elasticsearch
```bash 
## run test and export data
bash run_tests.sh android
bash run_tests.sh ios

## only export data
python3.6 export_xml_data_elastic.py android
python3.6 export_xml_data_elastic.py ios
```

## Creating Interactive Dashboard on Kibana
### Search on Kibana with timeString
Go to the Discover menu and select one item in the list then click the + button of the related filter item. Once you click the + button next to the timeString item it filters the search item with value timeString has.

### Create Visualizations
Click Visualize then click + button on the middle of the page, it will pop-up types of visualization menu then you can select one of your favorite charts. Then it opens the saved search item, you can select the search you saved in the previous step.

### Kibana setting the metrics and buckets
I choose the bar chart, later I will add one column to show the number of success, failure, and error. As you can see from the picture above you need to define the Metrics and the picture below shows how to split the chart for each run by setting the Buckets.

### Creating an Interactive Dashboard
Finally, we can create a Kibana Dashboard that can display every chart related to the automated test results. Click on the Dashboard menu and click the add button on the top-right then select the visualization that you created in the previous step. Thatâ€™s all! Now we can check the dashboard.

### Docker Run
To run the tests with the image:
```bash
> docker run --rm --network host -v $PWD/<path-to-xmls>:/code/reports gunesmes/export-xml-data-elasticsearch:latest <elastic-address-with-index> <project-name> /code/reports <api-key>
>
> docker run --rm --network host -v $PWD/build/test-results/test:/code/reports gunesmes/export-xml-data-elasticsearch:latest http://127.0.0.1:9200/app/suite apitest /code/reports no-key
```
